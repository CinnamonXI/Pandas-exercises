# Pandas-exercises
My solutions to pandas exercises by https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises in a bid to improve my knowledge of Pandas.

Day 1 of x of Pandas:
Attempted the [chipotle exercise](https://github.com/CinnamonXI/Pandas-exercises/tree/main/01%20-%20getting%20to%20know%20your%20data/exercise%202%20-%20chipo).

Day 2 of x of Pandas: Attempted the [occupation exercise](https://github.com/CinnamonXI/Pandas-exercises/tree/main/01%20-%20getting%20to%20know%20your%20data/exercise%203%20-%20occupation).

Day 3 of x of Pandas: Took the [chipotle exercise](https://github.com/CinnamonXI/Pandas-exercises/tree/main/02%20-%20filtering%20and%20sorting%20data/exercise%201%20-%20chipo) on data filtering and sorting.

Day 4 of x of Pandas: made up for three days I missed and did today's exercise
* [1. Euro12 exercise](https://github.com/CinnamonXI/Pandas-exercises/tree/main/02%20-%20filtering%20and%20sorting%20data/exercise%202%20-%20euro12),
* [2. Fictional army](https://github.com/CinnamonXI/Pandas-exercises/tree/main/02%20-%20filtering%20and%20sorting%20data/exercise%203%20-%20Fictional%20Army),
* [3. Alcohol consumption exercise](https://github.com/CinnamonXI/Pandas-exercises/tree/main/03%20-%20grouping/exercise%2001%20-%20Alcohol%20consumption) this is on grouping, 
* [4. Occupation](https://github.com/CinnamonXI/Pandas-exercises/tree/main/03%20-%20grouping/exercise%2002%20-%20Occupation).

Day 5 of x of Pandas: took the [regiment exercise](https://github.com/CinnamonXI/Pandas-exercises/tree/main/03%20-%20grouping/exercise%2003%20-%20Regiment).

In last 5 days of practicing Pandas, I've learnt about getting familiar with your data, filtering data, sorting data, grouping data. The use of Pandas functions such as `groupby()`, `sort_values()`, `sort()`, `value_counts()`, `counts()`, `set_index()`, `reset_index()`, `loc`, `iloc`, `isin()`, `agg()`, `apply()`, `unstack()`, and `size()`. Although I knew about most of these functions but I didn't know they accpted other parameters. Take for exampple the `reset_index()` takes a parameter *level* which accepts a list. what it does is to bring down the index to whatever level you give to it, you can check for the application [here](https://github.com/CinnamonXI/Pandas-exercises/blob/main/03%20-%20grouping/exercise%2002%20-%20Occupation/solution.ipynb).

Day 6 of x of Pandas: moved on to the apply folder and attempted the [student alcohol consumption exercise](https://github.com/CinnamonXI/Pandas-exercises/tree/main/04%20-%20apply/01%20-%20Students%20Alcohol%20Consumption). 

Day 7 of x of Pandas: concluded the apply exercise two [US crime rates](https://github.com/CinnamonXI/Pandas-exercises/tree/main/04%20-%20apply/02%20-%20US%20Crime%20Rates).

Day 8 of x of Pandas: started merging exercise [Auto MPG](https://github.com/CinnamonXI/Pandas-exercises/tree/main/05%20-%20merge/01%20-%20Auto%20MPG).

Day 9 of x of Pandas: attempted [Fictitious Names](https://github.com/CinnamonXI/Pandas-exercises/tree/main/05%20-%20merge/02%20-%20Fictitous%20Names).
